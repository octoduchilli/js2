    'content': 'The association was born in December 2017 out of a desire to popularize sciences by using everyone’s knowledge. The main motivation was to make students curious, above all, about research, its applications and new disciplines. Recently, we decided to go beyond the limits of our university to speak to all students and people interested in science in general. We decided to open this website, to share with you all our projects, to broadcast our magazine and our videos internationally.'

We have issued three editions that you can find in our Magazine section. This year we keep going with a highly motivated editorial team and coming from several cities in France and in Europe.',

In the longer or medium term we would like to organize interactive conferences in Paris or elsewhere.<br><br>We do our best to try to provide you with quality content that is not superficial. We hope we can continue to teach you things or even surprise you with our future achievements.'
